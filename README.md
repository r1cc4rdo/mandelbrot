# Mandelbrot set visualization

A vanilla python/numpy implementation of a Mandelbrot set visualizer.

The code has been liberally inspired by [this implementation by Jean-Fran√ßois Puget](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/my_christmas_gift).

Follow the [above link](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/my_christmas_gift) also for more information on the Maldebrot set and the colorization procedure.
