# Mandelbrot set visualization

A vanilla python/numpy implementation of a Mandelbrot set visualizer.

Open [the notebook](https://github.com/r1cc4rdo/mandelbrot/blob/master/Mandelbrot.ipynb) or the [standalone implementation](https://github.com/r1cc4rdo/mandelbrot/blob/master/mandelbrot.py) to see how to create pretty images like the following:

The code has been liberally inspired by [this implementation by Jean-Fran√ßois Puget](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/My_Christmas_Gift?lang=en).

Follow the [above link](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/My_Christmas_Gift?lang=en) also for more information on the Maldebrot set and the colorization procedure.
